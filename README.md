# Type-II Diabetes Prediction Model

This study will provide validated T2D prediction models, relevant in contemporary New Zealandâ€™s primary care. 

## Core Data
<a href="https://github.com/VIEW2020/DiabetesPrediction/wiki" target="_blank">See Wiki</a> for details regarding the core dataset including variable descriptions.<br></br>
The core dataset is a PREDICT population from 2006 - 2018. Individuals are eligeable if they are diabetes-free at time of PREDICT risk assessment and where an index HbA1c value is avaiable.
Inclusion does not limit the number of prior PREDICT assessments or prior CVD. Where eligeability is met at multiple PREDICT assessments, the earliest PREDICT record is used as baseline.

Information from the National Health Collection are linked to provide demographic, hospitalised history, hospitalised outcomes, death-specific outcomes, and baseline treatment. 
To ensure consistency, the exclusion criteria (see Wiki) have been applied in data management.
